# ThreefoldTerraformGenerator

The **root_menu** function is the main menu of the script. It displays a welcome message and a list of options to the user, then prompts the user to enter a selection. The user's input is validated to ensure it is a number between 1 and 4, and then the corresponding action is taken based on the selection. The available options are:

- Install Terraform
- Generate a main.tf
- Generate an env.tfvars
- Modify an existing example main.tf for deployment with env.tfvars file. 

The **install_terraform function** installs Terraform, if it is not already installed. The function checks if Terraform is installed by checking if the terraform command is available. If Terraform is already installed, a message is displayed to the user and the function exits. If Terraform is not installed, the function downloads and installs the latest version of Terraform.

The **generate_a_main_tf** function generates a main.tf file. This file is a configuration file for Terraform and contains the necessary information for deploying infrastructure with Terraform.

The **generate_a_env_tfvars** function generates an env.tfvars file. This file contains variables and their values that can be used in the main.tf file.

The **deploy_main_tf function** deploys the infrastructure described in the main.tf file using Terraform.

**FUNCTIONALITY STATUSES**

**New Functionality**
- Root Menu with 4 fucntions
	- install terraform
		- alpha feature, should work 
	- Generate a main.tf 
		- working with one known issue 
			- must restart script before generating a second main.tf or output blocks from previous main.tf's will print to new main.tf 
				-susupect handling of $OUTPUT_BLOCK
      - need to add output wiregaurd vm ip variable. 
	- Generate a env.tfvars
		- Working with minimal testing
	- Deploy a main.tf 
		- Untested, new start of feature

**Code Improvements**
- Input validation on most prompts
- Default Values on most prompts 

**Planned Features**
- Modify Exsisting Main.tf for use with env.tfvars
- Modify Exsisting Main.tf from outside provider for use with the grid. 
   - Reads Main.tf for deploying on outside provider and creates a replica grid deployment main.tf 
    - AWS Cloud Copy
    - Google Cloud Copy 
- Deploy a "***" functionality
  - Deploy a Forwarder, 
  - Deploy a Gateway 
  - Deploy Storage Devices



*Example Output of generate_a_main_tf*
This is unaltered output from the function with requested setup of 3 vms in a wiregaurd network with mutliple disks, and appropriate output variables for each vm 
- This can be immeadiately deployed using a env.tfvars file with 

```
terraform apply -parallelism=1 -auto-approve -var-file="/deployments/prod.tfvars"
```
